## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-22

### Why This Release

This release transforms Loa from a "fork-and-modify template" into an **enterprise-grade managed scaffolding framework** inspired by AWS Projen, Copier, and Google's ADK. The goal is to eliminate merge hell, enable painless updates, and provide ADK-level agent observability.

### Added

- **Three-Zone Model**: Clear ownership boundaries for files
  | Zone | Path | Owner | Permission |

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-22

### Why This Release

Manual markdown parsing for sprint task management is fragile and error-prone. This release integrates [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), a git-backed graph memory system, to provide deterministic task state management with dependency modeling, ready detection, and clean session handoffs. Additionally, we've centralized MCP server configuration into a single registry for easier maintenance.

### Added

- **Beads Integration**: Git-backed graph memory for sprint lifecycle management
  - Hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) for collision-resistant task tracking
  - Dependency types: `blocks`, `related`, `parent-child`, `discovered-from`
  - Ready detection via `bd ready` - returns tasks with no open blockers
  - Session persistence across context windows via `.beads/beads.jsonl`

- **Beads Helper Scripts** (`.claude/scripts/beads/`)
  | Script | Purpose |
  |--------|---------|
  | `check-beads.sh` | Verify installation status (supports `--verbose`) |
  | `install-beads.sh` | Multi-method installation with fallbacks |
  | `create-sprint-epic.sh` | Create new sprint epic |
  | `get-sprint-tasks.sh` | List all tasks under a sprint epic |
  | `get-ready-by-priority.sh` | Get ready work sorted by priority |
  | `sync-to-git.sh` | Commit beads state to git |

- **Beads Protocols** (`.claude/protocols/`)
  - `beads-workflow.md` - Comprehensive Beads workflow guide
  - `session-end.md` - Clean session handoff checklist

- **Centralized MCP Registry**: Single source of truth for MCP server configuration
  - `.claude/mcp-registry.yaml` - Registry with 6 servers (linear, github, vercel, discord, web3-stats, gdrive)
  - `.claude/scripts/mcp-registry.sh` - Query registry (list, info, setup, groups, check, required-by)
  - `.claude/scripts/validate-mcp.sh` - Validate MCP configuration
  - Skills now declare `integrations:` in index.yaml with required/optional servers
  - Commands use `integrations_source:` to reference registry

- **Enhanced Setup Wizard**: Guided Beads onboarding in Phase 0.6
  - User-friendly explanation of what Beads provides
  - AskUserQuestion prompts for installation confirmation
  - Multiple installation methods (official script, Go install, binary detection)
  - Verification step with success/failure feedback
  - Graceful degradation (markdown-only mode if skipped)

- **HITL Pre-flight Gate**: `/sprint-plan` checks for Beads before planning
  - Presents install options (brew/npm) via AskUserQuestion
  - User can continue without Beads for markdown-only workflow

- **Invisible Beads Lifecycle**: `/implement` handles `bd` commands internally
  - Users run `/implement sprint-1` - no manual bd commands needed
  - Task state persists across context windows when Beads available

- **Integrations Protocol** (`.claude/protocols/integrations.md`)
  - Documents lazy-loading pattern for MCP servers
  - Requires `yq` for YAML parsing

### Changed

- **Commands Updated for Beads**
  | Command | Changes |
  |---------|---------|
  | `/setup` | Phase 0.6 for Beads installation |
  | `/sprint-plan` | Creates Beads epic + tasks, archives to sprint.md |
  | `/implement` | Uses `bd ready` for task discovery, `bd update` for status |
  | `/review-sprint` | Records review notes via `bd update --notes` |
  | `/audit-sprint` | Closes sprint epic on approval |
  | `/update` | Merge strategy references skills/, protocols/, scripts/ |

- **Skills Updated for Beads**
  | Skill | Changes |
  |-------|---------|
  | `planning-sprints` | Added `<beads_workflow>` section, Phase 3.5 for graph creation |
  | `implementing-tasks` | Added `<beads_workflow>` section, Phase -2 Beads integration |
  | `reviewing-code` | Added `<beads_workflow>` section, `bd show --json` guidance |

- **MCP Configuration Unified**: `mcp_dependencies`/`mcp_requirements` renamed to `integrations`
  - Skills use `integrations.required` and `integrations.optional`
  - Commands use `integrations_source` pointing to registry

### Removed

- **Legacy agents directory**: `.claude/agents/` removed entirely
  - All 8 agent definitions migrated to `.claude/skills/` with 3-level architecture
  - Migration completed in v0.4.0, directory now deleted

### Fixed

- CI workflow now validates skills instead of legacy agents directory
- Added missing `--json` flags to `bd update` commands in skills for deterministic parsing

### Design Principles

1. **Determinism over parsing**: Always use `bd` commands with `--json` flag
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Skills reference `beads-workflow.md` protocol
3. **Graceful coexistence**: Keep `sprint.md` as optional human-readable archive
4. **Explicit uncertainty**: Agents must say "I don't know" when graph state is ambiguous
5. **Atomic updates**: One `bd` command per state change

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-21

### Why This Release

This release delivers a major architectural refactor based on Anthropic's recommendations for Claude Code skills development. The focus is on action-oriented naming, modular architecture, and extracting deterministic logic to reusable scripts—making skills more maintainable and reducing context overhead.

### Added

- **v4 Command Architecture**: Thin routing layer with YAML frontmatter
  - `agent:` and `agent_path:` fields for skill routing
  - `command_type:` for special commands (wizard, survey, git)
  - `pre_flight:` validation checks before execution
  - `context_files:` with prioritized loading and variable substitution

- **3-Level Skills Architecture**: Modular structure for all 8 agents
  - Level 1: `index.yaml` - Metadata and triggers (~100 tokens)
  - Level 2: `SKILL.md` - KERNEL instructions (<500 lines)
  - Level 3: `resources/` - Templates, scripts, references (loaded on-demand)

- **Context-First Discovery**: `/plan-and-analyze` now ingests existing documentation
  - Auto-scans `loa-grimoire/context/` for `.md` files before interviewing
  - Presents understanding with source citations before asking questions
  - Only asks about gaps, ambiguities, and strategic decisions
  - Parallel ingestion for large context (>2000 lines)
  - New script: `.claude/scripts/assess-discovery-context.sh`

- **8 New Helper Scripts** (`.claude/scripts/`)
  | Script | Purpose |
  |--------|---------|
  | `check-feedback-status.sh` | Sprint feedback state detection |
  | `validate-sprint-id.sh` | Sprint ID format validation |
  | `check-prerequisites.sh` | Phase prerequisite checking |
  | `assess-discovery-context.sh` | Context size assessment |
  | `context-check.sh` | Parallel execution thresholds |
  | `preflight.sh` | Pre-flight validation functions |
  | `analytics.sh` | Analytics helpers (THJ only) |
  | `git-safety.sh` | Template detection utilities |

- **Protocol Documentation** (`.claude/protocols/`)
  - `git-safety.md` - Template detection, warning flow, remediation
  - `analytics.md` - THJ-only tracking, schema definitions
  - `feedback-loops.md` - A2A communication, approval markers

- **Context Directory** (`loa-grimoire/context/`)
  - New location for pre-discovery documentation
  - Template README with suggested file structure
  - Supports nested directories and any `.md` files

### Changed

- **Skill Naming Convention**: All 8 skills renamed from role-based to action-based (gerund form)
  | Old Name | New Name |
  |----------|----------|
  | `prd-architect` | `discovering-requirements` |
  | `architecture-designer` | `designing-architecture` |
  | `sprint-planner` | `planning-sprints` |
  | `sprint-task-implementer` | `implementing-tasks` |
  | `senior-tech-lead-reviewer` | `reviewing-code` |
  | `paranoid-auditor` | `auditing-security` |
  | `devops-crypto-architect` | `deploying-infrastructure` |
  | `devrel-translator` | `translating-for-executives` |

- **Documentation Streamlining**: Reduced CLAUDE.md from ~1700 to ~200 lines
  - Detailed specifications moved to `.claude/protocols/`
  - Single source of truth principle enforced
  - Command tables reference skill files for details

- **discovering-requirements Skill**: Complete rewrite for context-first workflow
  - Phase -1: Context Assessment (runs script)
  - Phase 0: Context Synthesis with XML context map
  - Phase 0.5: Targeted Interview for gaps only
  - Phases 1-7: Conditional based on context coverage
  - Full source tracing in PRD output

- **Parallel Execution Thresholds**: Standardized across skills
  | Skill | SMALL | MEDIUM | LARGE |
  |-------|-------|--------|-------|
  | discovering-requirements | <500 | 500-2000 | >2000 |
  | reviewing-code | <3,000 | 3,000-6,000 | >6,000 |

  | implementing-tasks | <3,000 | 3,000-8,000 | >8,000 |
  | deploying-infrastructure | <2,000 | 2,000-5,000 | >5,000 |

### Breaking Changes

- **Skill Names Renamed**: All 8 skills have new names (see Changed section)
  - Custom commands referencing old names will need updates
  - Automation scripts using skill names must be migrated
  - Migration script available: `.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh`

### Migration Guide

If you have custom commands or scripts referencing old skill names:

```bash
# Run the migration script on your custom files
./.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh --check  # Preview changes
./.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh          # Apply changes
```

Or manually update references using this mapping:
- `prd-architect` → `discovering-requirements`
- `architecture-designer` → `designing-architecture`
- `sprint-planner` → `planning-sprints`
- `sprint-task-implementer` → `implementing-tasks`
- `senior-tech-lead-reviewer` → `reviewing-code`
- `paranoid-auditor` → `auditing-security`
- `devops-crypto-architect` → `deploying-infrastructure`
- `devrel-translator` → `translating-for-executives`

### Technical Details

- **Command Files Updated**: 10 commands with new skill references
- **Agent Files Renamed**: 8 agent files to match new naming
- **Index Files Updated**: 8 index.yaml files with gerund names
- **GitHub Templates Updated**: Issue templates reference new names
- All references to old skill names migrated throughout codebase

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-20

### Why This Release

Claude Code has a tendency to proactively suggest git operations—committing changes, creating PRs, and pushing to remotes—which can be problematic when working in forked repositories. Developers using Loa as a template for their own projects were at risk of accidentally pushing proprietary code to the public upstream repository (`0xHoneyJar/loa`).

This release introduces comprehensive safety rails to prevent these accidents while still enabling intentional contributions back to the framework.

### Added
- **Git Safety Protocol**: Multi-layer protection against accidental pushes to upstream template repository
  - 4-layer template detection system (origin URL, upstream remote, loa remote, GitHub API)
  - Automatic detection during `/setup` with results stored in marker file
  - Warnings before push/PR operations targeting upstream
  - Prevents accidentally leaking project-specific code to the public Loa repository

- **`/contribute` command**: Guided OSS contribution workflow for contributing back to Loa
  - Pre-flight checks (feature branch, clean working tree, upstream remote)
  - Standards checklist (clean commits, no secrets, tests, DCO)
  - Automated secrets scanning with common patterns (API keys, tokens, credentials)
  - DCO sign-off verification with fix guidance
  - Guided PR creation with proper formatting
  - Handles both fork-based and direct repository contributions

- **Template detection in `/setup`**: New Phase 0.5 detects fork/template relationships
  - Runs before user-type selection
  - Displays safety notice when template detected
  - Stores detection metadata in `.loa-setup-complete` marker file

- **`/config` command**: Post-setup MCP server reconfiguration (THJ only)
  - Allows adding/removing MCP integrations after initial setup
  - Shows currently configured servers
  - Updates marker file with new configuration

### Changed
- **Setup marker file schema**: Now includes `template_source` object with detection metadata
  ```json
  {
    "template_source": {
      "detected": true,
      "repo": "0xHoneyJar/loa",
      "detection_method": "origin_url",
      "detected_at": "2025-12-20T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }
  ```
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added Git Safety Protocol documentation and `/contribute` command reference
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated with contribution workflow using `/contribute` command
- **Documentation**: Updated setup flow diagrams and command reference tables

### Security
- **Secrets scanning**: `/contribute` scans for common secret patterns before PR creation
  - AWS access keys (AKIA...)
  - GitHub tokens (ghp_...)
  - Slack tokens (xox...)
  - Private keys (-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)
  - Generic password/secret/api_key patterns
- **DCO enforcement**: Contribution workflow verifies Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
- **Template isolation**: Prevents accidental code leakage from forked projects to upstream
