## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-21

### Why This Release

This release delivers a major architectural refactor based on Anthropic's recommendations for Claude Code skills development. The focus is on action-oriented naming, modular architecture, and extracting deterministic logic to reusable scripts—making skills more maintainable and reducing context overhead.

### Added

- **v4 Command Architecture**: Thin routing layer with YAML frontmatter
  - `agent:` and `agent_path:` fields for skill routing
  - `command_type:` for special commands (wizard, survey, git)
  - `pre_flight:` validation checks before execution
  - `context_files:` with prioritized loading and variable substitution

- **3-Level Skills Architecture**: Modular structure for all 8 agents
  - Level 1: `index.yaml` - Metadata and triggers (~100 tokens)
  - Level 2: `SKILL.md` - KERNEL instructions (<500 lines)
  - Level 3: `resources/` - Templates, scripts, references (loaded on-demand)

- **Context-First Discovery**: `/plan-and-analyze` now ingests existing documentation
  - Auto-scans `loa-grimoire/context/` for `.md` files before interviewing
  - Presents understanding with source citations before asking questions
  - Only asks about gaps, ambiguities, and strategic decisions
  - Parallel ingestion for large context (>2000 lines)
  - New script: `.claude/scripts/assess-discovery-context.sh`

- **8 New Helper Scripts** (`.claude/scripts/`)
  | Script | Purpose |
  |--------|---------|
  | `check-feedback-status.sh` | Sprint feedback state detection |
  | `validate-sprint-id.sh` | Sprint ID format validation |
  | `check-prerequisites.sh` | Phase prerequisite checking |
  | `assess-discovery-context.sh` | Context size assessment |
  | `context-check.sh` | Parallel execution thresholds |
  | `preflight.sh` | Pre-flight validation functions |
  | `analytics.sh` | Analytics helpers (THJ only) |
  | `git-safety.sh` | Template detection utilities |

- **Protocol Documentation** (`.claude/protocols/`)
  - `git-safety.md` - Template detection, warning flow, remediation
  - `analytics.md` - THJ-only tracking, schema definitions
  - `feedback-loops.md` - A2A communication, approval markers

- **Context Directory** (`loa-grimoire/context/`)
  - New location for pre-discovery documentation
  - Template README with suggested file structure
  - Supports nested directories and any `.md` files

### Changed

- **Skill Naming Convention**: All 8 skills renamed from role-based to action-based (gerund form)
  | Old Name | New Name |
  |----------|----------|
  | `prd-architect` | `discovering-requirements` |
  | `architecture-designer` | `designing-architecture` |
  | `sprint-planner` | `planning-sprints` |
  | `sprint-task-implementer` | `implementing-tasks` |
  | `senior-tech-lead-reviewer` | `reviewing-code` |
  | `paranoid-auditor` | `auditing-security` |
  | `devops-crypto-architect` | `deploying-infrastructure` |
  | `devrel-translator` | `translating-for-executives` |

- **Documentation Streamlining**: Reduced CLAUDE.md from ~1700 to ~200 lines
  - Detailed specifications moved to `.claude/protocols/`
  - Single source of truth principle enforced
  - Command tables reference skill files for details

- **discovering-requirements Skill**: Complete rewrite for context-first workflow
  - Phase -1: Context Assessment (runs script)
  - Phase 0: Context Synthesis with XML context map
  - Phase 0.5: Targeted Interview for gaps only
  - Phases 1-7: Conditional based on context coverage
  - Full source tracing in PRD output

- **Parallel Execution Thresholds**: Standardized across skills
  | Skill | SMALL | MEDIUM | LARGE |
  |-------|-------|--------|-------|
  | discovering-requirements | <500 | 500-2000 | >2000 |
  | reviewing-code | <3,000 | 3,000-6,000 | >6,000 |
  | auditing-security | <2,000 | 2,000-5,000 | >5,000 |
  | implementing-tasks | <3,000 | 3,000-8,000 | >8,000 |
  | deploying-infrastructure | <2,000 | 2,000-5,000 | >5,000 |

### Breaking Changes

- **Skill Names Renamed**: All 8 skills have new names (see Changed section)
  - Custom commands referencing old names will need updates
  - Automation scripts using skill names must be migrated
  - Migration script available: `.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh`

### Migration Guide

If you have custom commands or scripts referencing old skill names:

```bash
# Run the migration script on your custom files
./.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh --check  # Preview changes
./.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh          # Apply changes
```

Or manually update references using this mapping:
- `prd-architect` → `discovering-requirements`
- `architecture-designer` → `designing-architecture`
- `sprint-planner` → `planning-sprints`
- `sprint-task-implementer` → `implementing-tasks`
- `senior-tech-lead-reviewer` → `reviewing-code`
- `paranoid-auditor` → `auditing-security`
- `devops-crypto-architect` → `deploying-infrastructure`
- `devrel-translator` → `translating-for-executives`

### Technical Details

- **Command Files Updated**: 10 commands with new skill references
- **Agent Files Renamed**: 8 agent files to match new naming
- **Index Files Updated**: 8 index.yaml files with gerund names
- **GitHub Templates Updated**: Issue templates reference new names
- All references to old skill names migrated throughout codebase

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-20

### Why This Release

Claude Code has a tendency to proactively suggest git operations—committing changes, creating PRs, and pushing to remotes—which can be problematic when working in forked repositories. Developers using Loa as a template for their own projects were at risk of accidentally pushing proprietary code to the public upstream repository (`0xHoneyJar/loa`).

This release introduces comprehensive safety rails to prevent these accidents while still enabling intentional contributions back to the framework.

### Added
- **Git Safety Protocol**: Multi-layer protection against accidental pushes to upstream template repository
  - 4-layer template detection system (origin URL, upstream remote, loa remote, GitHub API)
  - Automatic detection during `/setup` with results stored in marker file
  - Warnings before push/PR operations targeting upstream
  - Prevents accidentally leaking project-specific code to the public Loa repository

- **`/contribute` command**: Guided OSS contribution workflow for contributing back to Loa
  - Pre-flight checks (feature branch, clean working tree, upstream remote)
  - Standards checklist (clean commits, no secrets, tests, DCO)
  - Automated secrets scanning with common patterns (API keys, tokens, credentials)
  - DCO sign-off verification with fix guidance
  - Guided PR creation with proper formatting
  - Handles both fork-based and direct repository contributions

- **Template detection in `/setup`**: New Phase 0.5 detects fork/template relationships
  - Runs before user-type selection
  - Displays safety notice when template detected
  - Stores detection metadata in `.loa-setup-complete` marker file

- **`/config` command**: Post-setup MCP server reconfiguration (THJ only)
  - Allows adding/removing MCP integrations after initial setup
  - Shows currently configured servers
  - Updates marker file with new configuration

### Changed
- **Setup marker file schema**: Now includes `template_source` object with detection metadata
  ```json
  {
    "template_source": {
      "detected": true,
      "repo": "0xHoneyJar/loa",
      "detection_method": "origin_url",
      "detected_at": "2025-12-20T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }
  ```
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added Git Safety Protocol documentation and `/contribute` command reference
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated with contribution workflow using `/contribute` command
- **Documentation**: Updated setup flow diagrams and command reference tables

### Security
- **Secrets scanning**: `/contribute` scans for common secret patterns before PR creation
  - AWS access keys (AKIA...)
  - GitHub tokens (ghp_...)
  - Slack tokens (xox...)
  - Private keys (-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)
  - Generic password/secret/api_key patterns
- **DCO enforcement**: Contribution workflow verifies Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
- **Template isolation**: Prevents accidental code leakage from forked projects to upstream

  - CHANGELOG excerpt display after update
- **Analytics system**: Usage tracking for feedback context
  - `loa-grimoire/analytics/usage.json` for raw metrics
  - `loa-grimoire/analytics/summary.md` for human-readable summary
  - Tracks: phases, sprints, reviews, audits, deployments
  - Non-blocking: failures logged but don't interrupt workflows
  - Opt-in sharing: only sent via `/feedback` command

### Changed
- **Fresh template**: Removed all generated loa-grimoire content (PRD, SDD, sprint plans, A2A files) so new projects start clean
- All phase commands now update analytics on completion
- `/plan-and-analyze` blocks if setup marker is missing
- `/deploy-production` suggests running `/feedback` after deployment
- Documentation updated: CLAUDE.md, PROCESS.md, README.md
